# **Fantasy Football Player Identification Model**

### **Overview**
This project uses **Linear Regression** to identify fantasy football players based on performance data and other attributes (like their name, position, and team). The model predicts a player's unique ID, generated dynamically from their attributes, based on the evidence provided. This tool is designed to analyze fantasy football player data and provide accuracy metrics, including sensitivity and specificity.

---

### **Features**
1. Automatically assigns unique IDs to players based on their name, position, and team.
2. Uses Linear Regression to predict a player's identity based on their performance data.
3. Evaluates model performance with metrics such as **Accuracy**, **True Positive Rate (Sensitivity)**, and **True Negative Rate (Specificity)**.
4. Splits data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
5. Dynamically rounds predictions to nearest integers for classification.

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/fantasy-player-identifier
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd fantasy-player-identifier
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

### **Usage**

1. **Prepare the Data**:
   - Ensure the input data is a CSV file with the following columns:
     - `name`: Player's name.
     - `position`: Player's position on the team.
     - `team`: Player's team name.
     - `total_points`: Fantasy football total points (optional for training but excluded as evidence).
     - Other numerical performance metrics to act as features (e.g., goals, assists, etc.).

2. **Run the Script**:
   Use the following command to train and test the model:
   ```bash
   python Fantazy.py data.csv
   ```

3. **Output**:
   The script will output:
   - Correct and incorrect predictions.
   - Accuracy metrics including sensitivity and specificity.
   - Model accuracy as a percentage.

### **Algorithm Used**

The model employs **Linear Regression**, a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous outcomes. Although linear regression is designed for continuous predictions, this project converts predictions into discrete IDs by rounding.

**Key Steps**:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - A unique identity number is dynamically assigned to each player using their name, position, and team.
   - The identity number is used as the target label for training the model.
2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Columns such as player name, position, and team are excluded from evidence features.
   - Only numerical performance metrics are included as evidence.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Splits the dataset into training and testing subsets using a 50% test size.
   - A Linear Regression model is trained on the training data.
4. **Prediction and Evaluation**:
   - The model predicts player identity numbers for the test data.
   - Predictions are rounded to the nearest integers to classify players.
   - Metrics like **accuracy**, **sensitivity**, and **specificity** are calculated to evaluate performance.

### **Evaluation Metrics**

1. **Accuracy**: Measures the overall percentage of correct predictions.
2. **Sensitivity (True Positive Rate)**: The proportion of correctly identified positive instances (specific player identities).
3. **Specificity (True Negative Rate)**: The proportion of correctly identified negative instances.

### **File Descriptions**

- `Fantazy.py`: The main Python script containing the model implementation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required dependencies.
- `data.csv`: Sample dataset (not included but expected to follow the described format).

### **Example**

**Input (CSV File)**:
| name          | position   | team        | metric1 | metric2 | total_points |
|---------------|------------|-------------|---------|---------|--------------|
| Player A      | Forward    | Team X      | 10.2    | 15.4    | 120          |
| Player B      | Midfielder | Team Y      | 5.6     | 8.9     | 80           |
| Player C      | Defender   | Team Z      | 2.1     | 5.2     | 50           |

**Running the Script**:
```bash
python Fantazy.py data.csv
```

**Output**:
```
Correct: 45
Incorrect: 5
True Positive Rate: 90.00%
True Negative Rate: 92.50%
Model Accuracy: 91.00%
```

---

### **Limitations**
1. The model assumes that all player performance data is numerical and meaningful for predictions.
2. Linear Regression may not be the ideal algorithm for classification tasks, though rounding predictions partially addresses this limitation.
3. The accuracy of predictions depends heavily on the quality and diversity of the dataset.
