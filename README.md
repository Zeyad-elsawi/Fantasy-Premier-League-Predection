This project implements a Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Player Identification Model using a Linear Regression algorithm to predict the unique identity of players based on their FPL statistics. The model assigns a unique ID to each player based on their name, position, and team. The dataset used consists of FPL player statistics for different game weeks, including features like goals, assists, and other performance metrics. The model can predict the player's unique ID based on this information.
